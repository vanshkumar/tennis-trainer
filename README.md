# Tennis Trainer

Tennis Trainer is an iPhone app that helps players practice smarter by showing what happens at the moment of ball‑racket contact. It works with the live camera or existing videos and overlays simple, easy‑to‑read cues on top of the action.

What it does (in plain English):
- Finds the tennis ball and tracks your swing in real time or from a saved video.
- Pinpoints when the ball meets the racket and marks that instant on screen.
- Tells you whether your forearm was roughly horizontal at contact (a common coaching cue).
- Plays a short beep for timing feedback while you hit.

Why it’s useful:
- Quick, visual feedback during solo practice—no sensors, no wearables, no internet required.
- On‑device processing for privacy and low latency.

Current scope:
- Designed for a training setup (camera behind the player); starting with right‑hand forehands.
- Work in progress as we refine contact detection for accuracy and consistency.
